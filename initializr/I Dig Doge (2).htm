				<h1>What Is This?</h1>
				<p>Okay, we'll start from the beginning. There's these things out there on the internet called cryptocurrencies. They're basically digital money. So instead of spending $1 on a candy bar, you could spend 100 Dogecoins.</p>
				<p>These currencies are made possible by a process called mining, which has two purposes. For one, it keeps the currency secure by making sure no one is spending more than they have. It also "prints" new money, which is the reward to the people who are mining. It's basically a bunch of math. But it works!</p>
				<p>Finally, we get to this site, which is a mining pool. Finding a good answer to these math problems takes a long time, and there's thousands of people attempting it. Pools let people work together on the problems. They solve more problems, and share the income, so it's a win for everyone!</p>
